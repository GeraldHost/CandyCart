Wordpress Candy Cart - E-commerce cart functionality for developers.

## What is Candy Cart?
### The Problem 
Wordpress seems to be a common options when looking for a e-commerce solution. With the use of plugins such as WooCommerce you can quickly have a e-commerce site up and running in a matter of hours. However, I've always felt there has been a bit of a gap between e-commerce solutions pre-built for the end user and those build specifically for developers. What if you don't want all the functionality offered by these larger plugin providers? What if you want something more than what they offer? What if you need something fully bespoke? And what if you don't want to have to configure every settings via a UI? 

### The Solution
I have started building Candy Cart as a solution to this problem. Instead of taking the traditional plugin route and building out a fancy dashboard UI with a number of configurable options I wanted to create a plugin that is more of an e-commerce library. With all of the foundations you would expect from an e-commerce solution but a level of flexibility that you can't get with off the shelf e-commerce systems.
